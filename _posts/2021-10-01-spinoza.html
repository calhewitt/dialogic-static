<p><strong>MMH: </strong>Spinoza was, on all surviving accounts, a good – if unexceptional – optician, a better maker of lenses than he was a theorist of them. The lens and its trickery are slightly thorny for empiricism at large: at once revelatory and deceptive. The lens puts all too sharply in focus the intervention of the body in perception. It is unsurprising then, if we grant a little psychoanalytic license, that Spinoza emerges as one of philosophy’s great elevators of the body. Spinoza – alongside Nietzsche, Bergson, Merleau-Ponty, and Deleuze (and Guattari) – is keen to disabuse us of any fantasy of the mind’s sovereignty – to stick our heads firmly back on our torsos. In particular, Spinoza the optician is under no illusions as to the casual relationship between mind and body; no object or concept registered by the senses has not already been physically secured and mediated by the body. But the lens does not only reveal to us the mechanical underpinnings of sense data, it also imperils the sovereignty of our inspection – muddies the freedom of the voyeur.</p><p>Like Hegel, Spinoza threatens to make freedom a redundant category. If increasing our power to act is really identical to aligning our will with an inescapable chain of causation, why bother to retain the comforting name of action. Hegel’s similar bait-and-switch is found in <em>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</em>, where meaningful freedom produces actions perfectly harmonious with and conducive to the laws and ends of the state. While Hegel seems primarily interested in neutralizing ‘freedom’ as a political weapon against his utopian state, Spinoza’s interest in making himself and his fellow thinkers free appears sincere. Our unhappy optician cannot doubt that the mind depends upon the body, but is not so much a determinist that he will give up the autonomy of mind altogether. Action still lurks somewhere in the swill of reaction but can give up no ground to contingency. Nietzsche resolved a similar problem with something of a fudge. In the emblem of a dice-throw he marries contingency and necessity, and warns us that scientists have spent far too long looking at reactions without wondering what forces everything is busy reacting to.</p><p>It is somewhat unclear whether Spinoza thinks we ever really act at all. In passages it seems clear enough that as parts of nature we are beholden to its laws, causes, and affects, but Spinoza is also focused on ways in which we can reduce the sway of affects and increase our power to act. To be disentangled from at least some particles of God's extension and to retreat into ourselves. A metaphysical thread seems to sustain Spinoza in the midst of his potential contradictions: necessary action, willed determinism. It is under the shelter of God’s attributes that we retain the possibility of elevation, not by overturning physical causation but by becoming wilfully embedded in it – by, to borrow Nietzsche’s phrase, throwing off <em>ressentiment. </em>And who is he who goes on resenting necessity, who cannot help but try to make the ignorant see more clearly?</p><p>Spinoza philosophizes against fear, most of all, against the fear which proceeds from apparent indeterminacy, and against the futile striving that accompanies that belief in indeterminacy. This said, he is not against striving, what are we to make of the <em>Ethics’</em> concluding remarks on the difficulty of dissolving oneself into the course of necessity and reaction? The split is not as easy as physical reaction, metaphysical action. The striving we should be doing has everything to do with seeing things properly, and who better than a lensmaker to know that seeing properly is a physical operation: a clearing of obstacles, a bringing into focus. What clings to me is the sense – amidst all Spinoza’s clarity, his endless ‘no doubt’s and Q.E.D.s – of almostness in the <em>Ethics</em>, of peeking between your fingers or squinting through your glasses. Look at the world, but only as much as you need to succumb to it. Understand reaction and the determinism of natural laws as abstractly as you can; walk backwards with your eyes closed into God’s embrace, but get a glimpse because you cannot help it. One of Borges’s sonnets for Spinoza pictures the philosopher dreaming up a clear labyrinth, and as he does so the ‘hands and space of hyacinth…<em>almost</em> do not exist’ for him.</p>
