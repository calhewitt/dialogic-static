<p><strong>JS:</strong>&nbsp;I would like to argue that the fluke of the blue whale pictured above is&mdash;from the standpoint of evolutionary biology, if not cosmic harmony&mdash;both a necessity and, well, a fluke.</p><p>The probability of life occurring on Earth as it did is probably vanishingly low, but how low we will never know until we can measure it against the probability of life on other planets, the so-called exoplanets that Kepler Space Telescope has been snooping around for since 2009. As of 2018, Kepler has found 3797 exo-planets in around 2851 star systems, but are any of the planets habitable? Apparently about 15% of them are in the Goldilocks Zone. But of those how many can plausibly make the epic trek from amino acids and proteins in the primordial soup of the sea to our magnificent blue whale and its shapely fluke? That percentage has not yet been worked out by anyone, so far as I know. But I suspect it is terribly low. What are the odds of abiogenesis?</p><p>The chances of big mammals emerging from the basic elements of a rocky planet orbiting a sun are so low that we should&mdash;as they say&mdash;thank our lucky star (and our mineral-rich seas) that life emerged in the first place. I don’t want to say we are fantastically “lucky” to be here but it does strike me that big-brained Homo sapiens sort of take existence for granted. I know I do. But every breathe I take&mdash;and every brain cell I oxidize into thought&mdash;should be properly regarded as an evolutionary miracle of staggering proportions. I wonder why it’s so difficult to keep this miraculous fluke steadily in mind. As someone trained in the natural sciences, you must have some thoughts about our flukish whale and the immense improbability of its very existence. And what precisely are the physics of abiogenesis? How did we get from cosmic inflation to the blue whale? Isn’t the transition from physics to chemistry to biology also one of the most peculiar narratives imaginable?</p><p><strong>CH:</strong> Emergence &ndash; the process by which we get chemistry from physics and biology from chemistry in turn &ndash; is one of the richest and least satisfactorily explained concepts in all science and the philosophy thereof. Here is the textbook toy example of emergence due to Conway:</p><p>Imagine an infinite chess-board where every square may be black or white: dead or alive. We evolve the state of the board in discrete steps according to three simple rules. Here I copy from Wikipedia;</p>
<i>
  <ol>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives;</li>
    <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell;</li>
    <li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
  </ol>
</i>


<p>What happens? <em>Structure </em>happens. Provided we initialize the board with the right state, we get self-contained units that move themselves around; units that replicate themselves; units that can destroy other units. Note that if we initialize an arbitrarily large board with an entirely random state these units will arise purely by chance. Here’s another thing: <em>the Game of Life board is Turing-complete</em>. That is, with the right starting state it can run through any calculation that can be solved by a digital computer. On our infinite-random board we can imagine any possible computer program existing and playing itself through. This might not be intelligence as we know it, but given the current state of AI it’s uncannily close. All from random chance and three simple rules. Compare the fact that there exists a theory of chess itself that is rich enough to fill innumerable books. A few more rules admittedly, but confined to an eight-by-eight.</p><p>How could we possibly anticipate any of this? Only by setting the whole thing going on a computer or a lifetime in the Hermitage of <em>good old English Algebra? </em>I, as someone who likes to talk to computers, would welcome the idea that computation <em>is </em>the answer &ndash; the only way that emergence might be reined in.</p><p>When Drake formulated his famous equation for the number of extant, detectable civilisations in the universe, he had to estimate the parameters you mention. Not P(blue whale) as such but they’re basically equivalent. Fascinatingly, he set f<sub>l</sub> and f<sub>i</sub> &ndash; the fractions of planets on which life could develop on which life <em>does </em>develop, and the fraction of those on which <em>intelligent</em> life develops, respectively &ndash; both equal to 1. Certain. These are by no means consensus opinions, but it’s within the realm of sensible possibility that the right &nbsp;conditions lead to intelligent life with a non-negligible, even high, probability. The point is that the right conditions are vanishingly rare.</p><p>Here is an important question<em>: to what extent is anthropic bias a satisfactory explanation for the apparent fine-tuning of our surroundings to life?</em> It must be asked on every level from the value of Planck’s constant, through the length of an Astronomical Unit, to the contents of our soil.</p><p>There is a linguistic point to be made about the notion of the probability of the present. I mean the question<em>, what is the probability that I am here saying this? </em>I wonder if it’s a case of scientific transcendence &ndash; the scale of the cosmos &ndash; obscuring the real point. The real point exists on the down-to-earth level of ‘how likely was it my parents shared their first kiss?’ and indeed on the even more cosmological ‘how likely is it the fundamental physical constants have the values they do?’. One might argue that the answer in all three cases is either ‘nonsense: undefined’ or ‘so small that we may consider it zero, and exactly how close to zero doesn’t matter’. So what?</p><p><strong>JS:&nbsp;</strong>As usual, there are 14.52 ways to reply to your ornate reflections on emergence. Here is one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am fairly certain that the “peas” reference is an homage from a Czech poet and immunologist to that assiduous and ingenious sorter of peas called Johann Georg Mendel, who did his work in Brno, where I partly lived and taught for two years long ago, offering a literary anatomy of the blue whale called “the canon of British literature.”</p><p>The whale’s fluke is extraordinary enough just as it is, but now we must add to it poetry not only about whales and microbes but about discovering principles of genetics by using our delicate fingers and opposable thumb and by using our mathematical mind. How to fathom all these emergencies? And the most stunning emergency of all must be that of consciousness, without which we simply could not recognize and ponder all these other emergent life-forms that billions of years of evolution parade before us.&nbsp;</p><p>A monk, Mendel was living in a kind of cell, a live one, next to other Monks who did not have a clue about why those peas were so important. And now here we are, locked-down in our little cells (mine is in West London), thinking about dead cells and dead neighbors, and wondering about the odds of biology becoming thanatology. The right conditions to make our cellular, dialogic lives possible are even spectacularly improbable. If our four parents had never kissed, no dialogic imaginations, no wings of thought. But what precisely had to kiss to get primordial physics off the ground? What immeasurably hot kiss (to go with that theory) had to occur for cosmic inflation to supply the conditions of possibility for protons, then hydrogen, helium, proteins, bacteria, primates and then the lustre in our PrimeMates’&mdash;our parents’&mdash;midnight eyes: the origin of our species of intellectual conversation? Is it all a fluke or the <em>opposite</em> of a fluke, once physics sprays itself into [a] universe?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CH: </strong>It is easy to see the succession of emergences<em> </em>as a great, inevitable chain reaction. Each step is reasonable enough &ndash; we’ll let it pass &ndash; but the results are startling when taken as a whole, rather like when a theorem is unfolded at the blackboard by a musty professor. It is easier still to see mankind perched on top, the final step, giving himself wings by pushing peas and cupping a fresh handful of his mass-produced Red Bull.</p><p>Is this the only way to see it? At the very least entropy &ndash; the great directionalizing force &ndash; pushes events along a certain rut. But I often think that physics, chemistry, and biology, cetology, thanatology, eschatology, and the rest, are merely different ways of seeing the same thing. One does not lead to the other, beyond the sense that the <em>human</em> philosopher using one as-paradigm might lead him to begin using the next. So we do not see <em>biology</em> arise, but rather <em>those things to which it is useful for biology to be applied</em>.</p><p>Now we see Mendel tending to his pea-plants. How <em>quiet</em> it is, now Brother Francis is brewing beer in the store-house and Brother John is mowing fields with a scythe. Organized society, cell by cell. I often struggle to reconcile the Very Poetry of genetics with the studious detachment of tending to one’s pea-plants. Years ago when we were talking about CERN and stealing Fire from the Gods I wondered where Prometheus was to be found amongst the mouseish activities of a thousand scientists hunched over monitors in their burrows deep underground. I thought: In a crystal lattice of atoms, propagating sound waves behave very much like particles; they are packets of energy with a defined momentum which can travel across the material and scatter off each other. And yet they amount to nothing more than small oscillations of each atom about its set place. [This is again an example of <em>ways of seeing</em>.] What if as a wave through the organization of human beings there could arise an emergent will?&ndash; the will of a being that would exist in a shimmering reality, its aspiration and acuity reaching far beyond that of any man. It could well be called a Titan or a God.</p><p>What folly! So, the last step is human folly. Or human guile. Human guile that looks like folly and folly that looks like guile. Is it Hubris to think as much? Hubris, where our wings come unstuck?</p><p>I know nothing of what sparked physics into action (no-one does), but isn’t it compelling to imbue it with the urgent emergence of a human kiss. Now or never:</p><p><em>To disintegrate on an instant in the explosion of mania</em><br><em>Or lapse for ever into a classic fatigue.</em></p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong>&nbsp;To Auden’s grim choice we can add Eliot’s predicted lapse: “This is the way the world ends…not with a bang [a Big one, because the universe clenched itself again] but a whimper”[because entropy’s rut is inevitable]&mdash;the last photon winking out a few trillion trillion trillion years from now.</p><p>Will? What are the physics of Will? Where there’s a will, there’s a wave? That thought brings me back to our whale fluke, from which hangs a tail/tale, thus.</p><p>Let us consider the will of a creature being its chief mode of propulsion, its way of pushing forward, its way of asserting itself, its forwardness. The brain sends its electrical signal and the tail does the heavy swishing and drives the creature into its future. The tail knows nothing of entropy. The tail is a brute’s force, its will to power, its instinct to move either to its prey or away from being prey. Is that propulsion an “explosion of mania”? Before I get to “Man” in his Promethean assertiveness and Titanic, anti-entropic follies and achievements, let me go backwards to the tiniest, most astonishing little motor of a tail. Here it is.</p>

<img src = "/media/dialogue_pictures/goldy/flagellum.png">


<p>Our blue whale’s fluke is also an example of evolution’s long push forward but it pales in comparison to the brilliant complexity of the bacterial rotary flagellum, which has been around for about 4 billion years. Indeed the “irreducible complexity” of this little tail has encouraged some to use it as proof of intelligent design. That is, this tail is the <em>opposite</em> of a fluke: it is too precise and marvellous <em>not </em>to have been designed by some intelligence, some divine Will that wanted to give its Creatures a push forward. Here is the sort of argument one gets by people who enjoying whipping us all into theological shape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>"IMAGINE A NANOTECHNOLOGY MACHINE far beyond the state of the art: a microminiaturized rotary motor and propeller system that drives a tiny vessel through liquid. The engine and drive mechanism are composed of 40 parts, including a rotor, stator, driveshaft, bushings, universal joint, and flexible propeller. The engine is powered by a flow of ions, can rotate at up to 100,000 rpm ... and can reverse direction in a quarter of a rotation. The system comes with an automatic feedback control mechanism. The engine itself is about 1/100,000th of an inch wide -- far smaller than can be seen by the human eye. Most of us would be pleasantly surprised to learn that some genius had designed such an engineering triumph. What might come as a greater surprise is that there is a dominant faction in the scientific community that is prepared to defend, at all costs, the assertion that this marvelous device could not possibly have been designed, must have been produced blindly by unintelligent material forces, and only gives the appearance -- we said appearance! -- of being designed. As you may have guessed, these astonishingly complex, tiny, and efficient engines exist. Millions of them exist inside you, in fact. They are true rotary motors that drive the "bacterial flagellum," a whip-like propulsion device for certain bacteria, including the famous&nbsp;</span><em >E. coli</em><span >&nbsp;that lives in your digestive system." (Peterson D., "The Little Engine That Could...Undo Darwinism," The American Spectator," 8 May 2005).</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Is this rapturous, even loving description of the little engine that could an example of folly and hubris, or wings that take us into the melting sun? Is the Final Fluke of Evolution a spirited Denial of Evolution in favour of a Designer? Is every way of seeing a wave of seeing? And what of gravitational waves? Or Virginia Woolf’s <em>The Waves</em>? Everything that moves makes a wave. Tails and tales push. Or does something pull them, the way the gravity of love pulls progenitors into the kiss that makes the world go round?</p><p><strong>CH:</strong> I find emergence, incidentally, to be one of the most elegant arguments against a Designer. We know emergence happens because we see it happen, much like evolution. Note then how our Designer is <em>not </em>working on a blueprint like the above but is rather putting the world together on the level of the fundamental laws of physics; he writes that <em>h</em> = 6.63&times;10<sup>-34</sup> and not that bacteria are to have a flagellum of a certain shape. And to foresee all the inevitable leaps from the initial crack (this is how the world <em>begins</em> &ndash; for the beginning is surely as terrible as the end) to flagella and flukes and ourselves running about sleeping with people and playing fives &ndash; why, He would have to be so tremendously intelligent as to be <em>not like us at all</em>. And why does He have to try the experiment so many times, planet after abortive planet? God does not play dice. I shall spend no more time down the grimy, waterlogged rabbit-hole of refuting creationism. It does fascinate me, however, how we refuse to let it go: I understand that to this day Elon Musk is giving interviews saying he thinks the world is a computer simulation. Technology has made us such good stage-conjurers that we begin to believe in magic again. Do you ever worry that digital computers will undo the Enlightenment?</p><p>Tails do not see entropy because entropy is the bigger picture&mdash;entropy is what you get when you zoom out. We take a vast, bustling system &ndash; complexity that beggars all description &ndash; and assign a single number to it. We prove by algebra that whatever goes on inside, push and pull, <em>velis</em> and <em>nolis</em>, that single number must obey a rule: it must always tick upwards. Not even Maxwell’s Demon &ndash; that insufferable little Puck borne of one of the greatest minds that ever lived &ndash; can stop it. I suppose this approach to physics is the opposite of giving the problem to a digital computer &ndash; Grandmaster of the Game of Life // made of electronic circuits &ndash; and seeing what comes out, quite by magic. If we give a computer a real system (even the whole world) we will only see what chaos may come in a few seconds’ time. With Maxwell we see what will happen in a trillion, trillion years. (How calm it is. Entropy rounds the edges off us. It is quite like civilization.)</p><p>Is it now time to zoom in? In the grand history of paradigms, waves beget wavefunctions.</p><p><strong>JS:</strong> &nbsp;Ionic flows make the tiniest of waves (or wakes) but nothing&mdash;I suspect&mdash;in comparison to the waves that electrons make. What happen to our flukes of nature when we zoom in on the behaviour of electrons? Isn’t the word “behaviour” already far too anthropomorphic to describe anything outside of ourselves? To what extent are the words “wave” and “particle” metaphors? And “wavicle”?&mdash;a portmanteau suggesting that physics often gives linguistics cramps.&nbsp;</p><p>Is it possible to subtract our behaviour (Man is the <em>measurement</em> of all things?) in observing the wavefunction of atoms or electrons? How far are we measuring our own measurements? And what does consciousness have to do with these questions? What if consciousness also makes waves? Indeed, how could it not? Wavefunctions beget all these questions, which are also quests. I take it that physicists disagree about how to interpret wavefunctions.</p><p>The founding question of philosophy is “what is?” Quidditas. But does quantum wavefunction defy this question? “What is waving?” may be a non-sensical question, a meaningless quest with no grail waiting at the end. Is the word “is” misleading?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CH:</strong> Let me take a moment to de-mystify<em> </em>the wavefunction (in also the sense of disentangling it from the Mystic). I find the basis of quantum mechanics to be a thoroughly clear<em> </em>theory, and we do it an injustice by calling it a brain-buster.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>For our electron, let us define a function V across space. A function across space is simply a number which has a different value according to position. The temperature at each point in a room, for example, defines a function across space. It is anything we can plot on a graph with a position co-ordinate on the x-axis. V tells us what <em>potential energy</em> the electron would have at a particular point. Climbing up a hill in the presence of gravity would give an electron potential energy. (Though we find gravity holds little sway on the quantum scale.) So would being near a like &ndash; repulsive &ndash; charge. We then look for pairs of functions &phi; and numbers E which obey a rule. That rule is the Schrödinger Equation. Namely, the curvature of &phi; at any point must equal E-V times &phi;, up to a constant. By the curvature of a function I mean specifically ‘how quickly does its slope (imagine it plotted on a graph) change with position?’ There might be any number of &phi;s that fit the rule, but we find that each of them has only a single E that will work with it. We call these &phi;s <em>eigenstates of energy </em>because they have a well-defined value of energy, namely their corresponding E. Now, the rule that the electron obeys is that its wavefunction, &psi;, might be any of these &phi;s, or it might be a linear combination of them&mdash;that is to say, if &phi;<sub>1 </sub>and &phi;<sub>2</sub> were possible &phi;s, then &psi; could be &phi;<sub>1 </sub>or it could be &phi;<sub>1 </sub>+ 3&phi;<sub>2</sub>. (I’m disregarding <em>normalization</em> for now). If left unobserved, the electron’s wavefunction cycles through the possible &psi;s according to an exact, perfectly deterministic rule. It is impossible to measure &psi; directly.</p><p>Suppose we make a measurement of something we can observe: the electron’s position, let’s say. The result of our measurement will be chosen randomly<em> </em>according to a probability distribution that depends on &psi;. For position, the appropriate distribution is simply the magnitude of &psi;, squared. Once a measurement has been made, the electron’s wavefunction jumps <em>discontinuously</em> to a different &psi; which is associated a well-defined position (naturally, we call this an <em>eigenstate of position</em>). If we immediately make a second observation of the position, we will always get the same answer as we did the first time around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, that’s quantum mechanics. It came out rather longer than I’d hoped, but it feels in the spirit of this dialogue to include it complete. What can we make of it? One of the reasons people say it’s clearly wrong is that we’ve defined an arbitrary class of actors &ndash; observers; ‘us’ &ndash; who exclusively are able to make wavefunctions jump. (To be able to observe in this sense is not unique to man. Radioactive nuclei, for example, are quite able to observe themselves.) But surely we too are quantum systems whose wavefunctions should intermingle continuously and evolve according to the deterministic rules? It appears we are not &ndash; there is something peculiar to the Observer Class that can interrupt the clockwork and force nature’s dice to be rolled.</p><p>As we zoom out, the Newtonian regime emerges &ndash; in which the values of observables give you (almost) complete information about a system. So the act of observation is all that introduces randomness into the world, but on the scale of human beings or even neurons firing in the brain it only introduces the <em>slightest sliver </em>of randomness, albeit one that classical chaos can amplify. (Or indeed the psychopath can amplify who rigs his Geiger-counter to a cat-killing machine.)</p><p>Are we now in a position to observe the quiddity of the electron? I wonder if the confusion lies in that although electrons are simples as building-blocks of nature, they are complexes in our understanding. Namely, they are the logical sum of all the regimes of physics<em> </em>we apply to them, and each suggests its own <em>what?</em>. Electron wavefunctions interfere according to the same law as water-waves, so we say an electron <em>is </em>a wave. Zoom out and we see an electron bump around like a billiard ball so we say it <em>is </em>a billiard ball. We may dress nature in whatever quiddities we like and we’re left with different impressions of what is and what is important. It is the same electron all along.</p><p><strong>JS:</strong> What exactly is the Observer Class and what makes it peculiar and lets it roll the dice? Is any act of consciousness a roll of the dice? What is quantum consciousness? To be <em>and</em> not to be?&nbsp;And I don’t know what you mean by “the slightest sliver of randomness.” Is even that sliver an epistemological/ontological game-changer? If the observer is necessarily part of the observation, when what does it matter how much or how little the observation alters: that it alters <em>at all</em> is the point, no?</p><p>What are the odds that any other creature in the universe, even given millions of fecund exo-planets, could ever develop in such a way as to produce the dialogue we are now evolving? I imagine there are bluish whalish creatures sliding silently through vast seas on planets millions of light-years away from us, but the chances of Cal-like or James-like brains cavorting dialectically are, I would suggest, zero. I am not flattering us. I am simply failing to imagine that our way of making waves isn’t, after all, a singular fluke.</p><p><strong>CH:</strong> All macroscopic phenomena emerge from quantum mechanics (except those that don’t, like gravity) but they often retain few of the characteristics of a quantum phenomenon on the quantum scale. One of those characteristics is dice-rolling upon observation. Quantum randomness is often brought up in the context of the all-too-tired Free Will problem: if the brain is clockwork, a very accurate brain-scan could tell me my state of mind in ten minutes’ time. Introduce the vestiges of quantum mechanics on the neuron-scale, and that might change to ‘a very good approximation of my state of mind’. Has that really given me free will if I didn’t have it already? I don’t think so. There is no quantum consciousness.</p><p>The distinction I’m picking at is between the true randomness of quantum systems and what a computer programmer would call pseudorandomness. The state of a chaotic system under many iterations of a deterministic law is pseudorandom. A computer processor cannot generate truly random numbers by itself, but in most practical cases pseudorandomness will suffice. I wonder how many of our flukes of nature are in fact Newtonian-chaotic pseudo-flukes.</p><p>As an analogy: suppose I (or Hamlet) delegate some decision to the toss of a coin. A measurement of the coin’s orientation and velocity just after it left my hand could tell an engineer (probably, just about) the result of the toss ahead of time. Suppose instead I base my choice on the vital status of Schrodinger’s Cat. Has anything <em>really </em>changed?</p><p>I recall the slightly nauseating TV-astronomer spiel about fifty billion galaxies behind your thumbnail at arm’s length. Except now, fifty billion seems rather a small number of trials to reproduce <em>exactly us</em>. All our quiddities considered, I’d say zero. Confidently.</p><p>Here’s a fun challenge that has just occurred to me: by thinking alone, generate a number (let’s say a single bit; 0 or 1) as randomly as possible. How might we tap into the faint waving of quantum effects in our brain? I mean that as a practical question.</p><p><strong>JS:</strong> Why not just contemplate not <em>psi</em> but <em>pi</em>?.&nbsp;Not a fluke, but a mind-henge? What might that do to our brains, if not our branes? Speaking of brains, I will be wanting shortly to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shift to the other end of our whale, its mighty head.</p>

<p><strong>CH:</strong> Pi: numerical complexity and numerical chaos hiding just behind the circle, that perfectly-rounded symbol of just-rightness in the world.</p><p>Should we examine our assumption of just-rightness? To what extent is the world <em>really </em>a hospitable place? The family in war-ravaged Yemen would be surprised to see us answer that question with reference to the value of Planck’s constant.

<h2 style = "text-align: center">II</h2>

<p><strong>JS:&nbsp;</strong>As if a whale’s fluke isn’t interesting—and possibly lethal—enough, Herman Melville writes a memorable chapter in <em>Moby Dick</em> on a sperm whale’s massive head and the man (Tashtego) who is charged with digging a well into it so he can remove bucket after bucket of sperm-like oil. It is the finest oil in the whale, apparently, and is “just right” (for exploitation) to sell to merchants and entrepreneurs back in thriving Nantucket (for lamps but also to lubricate the machines of the Industrial Revolution). The Goldilocks Zone of the sperm whale, that is, is in it head, at least that’s how whalers and merchants see it. The brain of the mighty beast is negligible, according to the seamen. Ahab is alone in wondering what Moby Dick might be thinking when he exacts his terrible revenge on the men who would kill him. Melville ends his chapter in a way that has made my own head hurt with conjecture. Tashtego ends up falling into the great hole he has made in the slaughtered whale’s head, but he survives the plunge.</p><blockquote>Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into&nbsp;Plato’s honey head,&nbsp;and sweetly perished there?</blockquote><p>Now, to return obliquely to one of your questions above, one could argue that, for the poor sperm whale, cavorting through Pacific Ocean, there is no Goldilocks Zone because men have so mercilessly imperilled the very survival of its species, roughly 20 million years in the making, and a few billion years before that if you go back to the origin of life on Earth. Only man (John Grey calls us <em>homo rapiens</em>) is vile and greedy enough to effectively undo the evolutionary biodiversity occasioned by living for 5 billion years in the Zone. Melville is not an early David Attenborough, but he is a complicated writer who sees many sides to his whale and the eager whalers who manage to think of sperm and death in the same breath. The more dead sperm whales, the more oil, the more oil, the more profit.</p><p>We presently have the other end of our whale to ponder: the end that also, in one case, actually did bring down a ship (the <em>Essex</em>), killed many sailors, and thereby took its revenge on <em>homo rapiens</em>, some of whom seem hell-bent on turning Life into Death and laughing all the way to the [sperm-oil] bank.</p><p><strong>CH:</strong> For much of the history of science the standard unit of luminous intensity was the brightness of one candle of pure spermaceti. When Thomas Young carried out the experiments that led to quantum mechanics he would always light his apparatus with a candle because, in the absence of a LASER, it was a good source of near-coherent light. It seems true to the flukiness of our flukes of nature that such brutality and absurdity should lie (obliquely) behind their discovery.</p><p>Absurdity indeed for he whose brief candle is snuffed out floundering in the head-juices of a sea-beast, his garments heavy with viscous slop pulled down to greasy death. It seems to me the whaler amongst the storm and stench of the whale-ship would feel just as far from the Goldilocks Zone as his prey. Does it not seem the perfect sketch of the romantic idea—man as defined by his being-in-adversity, and his adversity is Nature? (Perhaps that is the whole idea of <em>Moby-Dick</em>, but I have not read it.)</p><p>All of this talk of harpooning gives me a heart (a heart the size of a small car) for these great creatures: an affinity between singing species. Is that a romantic idea? Is it also a romantic idea to feel a deep sadness for how our science lets us tame and level and scorch the surroundings that once overpowered us at sea and weathered us in a lofty mountain pass?</p><p>Wandering the swept-empty streets of Canterbury (it still feels like a bad zombie film) I was struck by the song a sperm-whale might sing at the news of the eradication of <em>homo rapiens</em>. Like a shepherd’s song after a storm. Rather like the last movement of Beethoven’s Pastoral.</p><p><strong>JS: &nbsp;</strong>Physics, chemistry, and biology Giveth, and <em>homo rapiens</em> Take Away. At the end of his documentary about sperm whales—where his cameraman films a rare, baby “Moby Dick,” Attenborough says, “We would once have slaughtered a white whale like this without a thought. But now, a more respectful relationship has begun to emerge through watching whales. Already it’s begun to yield riches by illuminating not our lamps but our sense of wonder of the creatures with which we share the world.”&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder if human beings ever give much thought of the extent to which they have turned back the Goldilocks Zone and indulged recklessly in a kind of anti-genesis, de-creating the world and the conditions of possibility for continued life. Certainly, we are more concerned by our killing of the planet than we were fifty years ago. And harpoons launched by massive guns into whales are now mostly illegal. Whale populations are increasing again, very slowly.</p><p>But how and why did human beings become so expert at destroying the Goldilocks Zone for so many creatures? Is there any other organism so destructive as human beings? We are so aggressive and bellicose that Freud was forced to posit a force opposing Eros: he called it Thanatos, and argued that we all have a Death Instinct (Hamlet’s “not to be”) that, when turned outwards, becomes aggression—the will to make others “not be.” Even the harpooner, trying to feed his growing family back in Nantucket, probably enjoyed hurling his spear into the lungs of sperm whales. Human beings wipe out an extraordinary number of species on a weekly basis. According to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, <span style="background-color: white;">humans have caused the annihilation of 83% of all wild mammals and half of all plants. Is there anything more absurd—and ethically despicable—than the products of flukes wiping out other products of flukes, including giant and peaceful mammals with flukes for tails?</span></p><p><strong>CH:</strong> Is Dostoevsky’s Raskolnikov the perfect model for <em>homo rapiens </em>et<em> sapiens</em>? Like Raving Rodion our species proves by algebra that we’ve every right to take a hatchet to our forests and seas and populations of white whales. We shall be hailed in the public square for making the world a more forward place. A race of Napoleons, we step over the little acts: one oak felled, one lung harpooned. On <em>that tearful day when guilty man shall arise again from the ashes to be judged </em>– we shall give a neat confession that <em>we only killed to steal</em>. And we shall be sentenced to eight years in the inferno only.</p><p>I fear that stepping back from humanity too, you see the actions of petty madmen. Sordidly intellectual madmen who kill very much for killing itself. Who build themselves low-ceilinged squalid rooms and places like old St Petersburg. How do we answer the charge? We do not harpoon whales any more, nor do we send people to Siberia for printing books. Does the story of humanity come with a bizarre moralizing epilogue like that tacked onto <em>Crime and Punishment </em>or <em>Don Giovanni</em>? At last found (Christian) love?</p><p>I am for now, for better or worse, stuck with the image of Goldilocks bludgeoning the three bears.</p><p><strong>JS:</strong>&nbsp;Our Bible reading for the day must be:</p>


<blockquote><em>Genesis 1:26-28&nbsp;King James Version (KJV)</em><br>
  <sup><strong>26&nbsp;</strong></sup>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br><sup><strong>27&nbsp;</strong></sup>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<br>
  <sup><strong>28&nbsp;</strong></sup>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</blockquote>


  <p>The Bible gave us “dominion over” the earth, which could be taken to mean “domination” or “stewardship” depending if you translate the Hebrew word <em>radah</em> as “skilled mastery among&nbsp;[or,&nbsp;with respect to]”, rather than “brute force over.” What follows this famous Bible verse is a cheerful affirmation of vegan food chains where no blood is spilt and where the earth is a garden of abundance for all its inhabitants.</p><p>We may have taken a break from slaughtering whales, but we still have dominion over (kill) 55 African elephants every day. And if you energetically oppose Putin in the press or on the streets, you can be gunned down or thrown in prison.</p><p>I think we must consider the possibility that violence is not an aberration of human behaviour but a rule. Having been given the most precious gift/fluke of life, human beings have been singularly-talented at destroying not only their own ecosystem but the ecosystems of millions of other species. <em>Homo rapiens</em> is a gifted killer. As my (dead) teacher John Gardner wrote in his novel, <em>Grendel</em>, “No wolf was ever so cruel to other wolves.” When the whalers had thrust their early harpoons into a sperm whale, it would race across the surface of the sea until it tired. The seamen referred to this exciting burst of speed as “a Nantucket sleigh ride” and whooped and cheered like boisterous boys. On rare occasions the whale would have the strength to dive and the boat would capsize; rarer still were the occasions when the whale’s fluke came crashing down on the whalers, spanking them to death and sending them down to the hydrothermal vents (a Goldilocks Zone in itself) that invented them over 3.7 billion years ago. The circle of life? The circle of death? To be or not to be? Who decides? The will to power? Consciousness? Appetite? Lust? Greed? Intelligence? The opposable thumb? Saddest of all: the Imagination?</p><p><strong>CH:</strong> Is it possible to discuss the environment these days without escaping politics? To what extent can the worst destructive urges of <em>homo rapiens </em>be stemmed by the political process? By grave blue-suited diplomats signing protocols? By students singing in the streets? Or like Rousseau thought, by education itself? To what extent has this dialogue made you want to glue yourself to the DLR? If not, what is the answer? After such crimes against his dominion, how else can the tyrant be deposed?</p><p>What sort of a trial should we give the profiteering top-hat capitalists who staged the industrial revolution at the expense of innumerable whales? What trial for the harpooner who relished every bump and slide of the Nantucket sleigh ride? Can we find them guilty of a crime it was only their nature to commit? Was it worth it, after all, as long as we don’t go any further? Can we really look down on them with the patronizing glare of the examining-magistrate and sentence them to guilt?</p><p><strong>JS: </strong>This dialogue has plunged like a harpoon from wonder to cynicism. “Harpoon” is a beautiful word and I’ll bet that harpoon makers were artisans who took pride in their work and did not spend much time—or any time—thinking the whales drowning in the blood in their lungs, just as those who design and assemble Hellfire drones don’t spend any time pondering the collateral damage (innocent civilians) who end up blown to bits.</p>

  <p>I include these improvements on the harpoon to show our technological genius for death and destruction. I don’t know how to put this talent for death and anti-Goldilocks thinking on trial or how to punish the humankind for its murderous ingenuity. I am left to consider the justice of John Gray’s lugubrious but oddly serene observations.</p><p>Homo rapiens is only one of the very many species, and not obviously worth preserving. Later or sooner, it will become extinct. When it is gone the Earth will recover. Long after the last traces of the human animal have disappeared, many of the species it is bent on destroying will still be around, along with others that have yet to spring up. The Earth will forget mankind. The play of life will go on (<em>Straw Dogs</em>, 151).</p><p>Is the only good news (gospel) that the creatures who gave us lyric poetry, H-bombs, champagne, mustard gas, CERN, Walmart and Paradise Lost will eventually pass into nothingness, and the tired old Earth will get a chance to breathe again?</p>

  <p><strong>CH:</strong> This man is the <em>Remueur</em>. He is a character from the earlier days of Traditional Method champagne production. His job is to give each bottle a slight twist, one day to the right, two days later to the left. This has the effect of disturbing and nudging the sediment towards the bottle’s neck. After eight weeks in the Remueur’s care, another winemaker will – in a practised flourish – pop off the cap and plug his thumb in the bottle when the sediment and nothing more has escaped. The result is a crystal-clear, bottle-fermented champagne.</p><p>We are more than one of the many species. In our corner of the galaxy at least, the succession of emergences, formation of planets, and biological evolution have culminated in us. Is that hubristic of me? Very well, it is hubristic. The meticulous work of the Remueur proves it true beyond any doubt.</p><p>I believe in our right to keep-being for the same reason the drinker of our champagne (I am considering it delivered to a rather existential type who happens to be living in Paris around the 1920s) keeps sipping in sumptuous nightclubs rather than throwing himself in the Seine. Yes, he has petrified his liver and blackened his lungs. But he has lived authentically and well.</p><p>I see Gray in his somewhat illuminating stupidity as a Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Let not the world be a better place for our not-being! And let not the world return to a boring paradise – yet another boring paradise amongst billions – until it whimpers into the heat-death. Let us raise a glass to the world that – for all our faults – let us live. Let us live!</p><p><strong>JS:</strong>&nbsp;The Remueur rotates the bottles until the champagne is “just right.” Gravitational waves rotate planetary bodies until the biosphere is the just the right temperature for primordial soup to serve up single cells, lively little devils that enjoin others—even dead cells—to join the party, and <em>voila!</em>—the effervescence of Life, the wit of the dying Oscar Wilde, in Paris, in 1900. And when someone handed Wilde, in his cell of a room, a glass of champagne, he dryly observed, “I am dying beyond my means.” On the way to one of my favourite pubs in London (<em>The Harp</em>, near Charing Cross), there is a marble monument to Wilde.</p>

  <p style="float: left">I suppose we could say that John Gray remains in the gutter, but some of us—in conversation with Oscar Wilde and with each other—are looking at the stars and the Goldilocks Zones they warm to life. Yes, human beings can be brutal bastards, but they are also what Byron calls “fiery dust” (stardust, it turns out), and capable of great goodness, beauty, and wit so lively that one simply cannot put a cork in it. That spark of intelligence is never so bright or suggestive as in the last line of the passage from <em>Moby Dick</em> we have not yet pulled into our conversation.</p><blockquote><em>How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into&nbsp;Plato’s honey head,&nbsp;and sweetly perished there?</em></blockquote><p>I would like to fall into that honey head with you in the final section of this dialogic trilogy. For now, I would simply observe the cultural and spiritual superiority of the Irish Harp over Nantucket harpoon, which brings me to lyre of Yeats, singer of death and life.</p>



  <blockquote><pre>A barricade of stone or of wood;
Some fourteen days of civil war:
Last night they trundled down the road
That dead young soldier in his blood:
Come build in the empty house of the stare.

We had fed the heart on fantasies,
The heart’s grown brutal from the fare,
More substance in our enmities
Than in our love; O honey-bees,
Come build in the empty house of the stare.</pre></blockquote>

  <p><strong>CH:</strong> And so we reach wit. Preeminent delicacy of the Goldilocks Zone. Of all our phenomena of the head, wit is the caviar on Salome’s platter. Or perhaps the cucumber sandwiches. As perfect as the pointed pop of a bubble in our frothing, bready glass. Recall the words of Dom Perignon as he perfected the first iteration of the<em> Method</em>: Come quickly, for I am drinking the stars!</p><p>It strikes me that our ideas have developed too effervescently to even pretend to be consistent. We’ve tossed between cynicism and the will to full-blooded life as quickly as neurons firing in a real mind, and now this section has been lured away by the thought of a drink and died well beyond its means. It may be said we’re persons of no principles at all. And we may rest our conversation easy in the knowledge that Oscar would like us more than anything in the world.</p>
