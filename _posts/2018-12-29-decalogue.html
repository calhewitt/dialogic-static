<pre>The madman walked to the town square asking 'where is Soderholm, where is Soderholm?'
And the townsmen who were all atheists, laughed at him 'do you not know that Soderholm is dead'
And it began
The festival of atonement:
Why and how has he died
The mysterious Carribbean illness
But let us Drink Atonement. Tristan!

Thank you SoDaHome
For the delectable drink
You are a Real Boi

We have killed your initials father, I am sorry father
You left us, daddy your whisky was so sweet and so cold
Do you have some Dickinson for this

Hypocrite lecteur!
And you are but the father
O, what of the child

I really don’t know what to say
To be replaced

But not yet
You have a nice nose
I would like to put oil upon it
With all ten of my tickling fingers

Your kind Persian rug
Can we spit on it, once more
Soft pipes why delay

I wrote a Haiku
I don’t even know the man
But I love him still

Ophelia is
Quite possibly awful, yes,
A great gin lover

This is getting bad
End it now
Have a hug with me instead</pre>
