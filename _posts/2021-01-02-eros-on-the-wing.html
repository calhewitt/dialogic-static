<p><strong style=" ">SW:</strong><span style=" ">&nbsp;For a long time I have pondered the importance of eroticism for the spiritual and creative life of man. Eros, whose etymology is partly unknown, is often equated with “love” or “desire”. One of the earliest accounts of the Greek god, attributed to Hesiod, describe him as one of the primordial gods. Eros was one of the creators of the universe alongside Chaos, Gaia and Tartarus. According to Hesiod, Eros “rules over the minds and the council of gods and men” and is fundamental to the creation of the world in that he balances the conflicting elements that Chaos consists of. There is a connection between Eros, balance and symmetry that I find captivating. Since the first discussion of the philosophical eros in Plato’s </span><em style=" ">Symposium</em><span style=" ">, it has been placed between wealth and poverty (to have and not to have, to desire). Eros moves in the outer realms of the limits of our consciousness and strives for its expansion, towards the infinite. If Eros is a force that drives us forward, is there then a connection to creativity and creation? And what would the ancient Greeks say about our society’s distortion of the word “erotic”?</span></p><p><strong style=" ">JS:&nbsp;</strong><span style=" ">What would the Greeks say? That we had clinically shrunken their generous and suggestive idea of Eros to make it narrowly-sexual, and fairly uninteresting at that. Two moments from William Blake’s “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” come to mind.</span></p>



<blockquote><pre>How do you know but every bird
that cuts the airy way
Is an immense world of delight,
closed by your senses five?

If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.
For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.</pre></blockquote>



<p>Blake imagined a “new heaven of artistic creativity” where our aesthetic sensibility was not at all closed off or narrow, but flourished as what Freud might call “polymorphous perversity” -- capable of many forms of pleasure and excitement. I think the ancient Greeks might see Blake and even Freud as struggling to return to a less repressed and restrictive understanding of Eros. Many of Blake’s illustrations are an attempt to depict ‘Eros’ and therefore to cleanse our doors of aesthetic perception.</p><p>In <em>Symposium</em> and <em>Phaedrus</em>, Plato blends philosophy and Eros so happily that it is difficult to pull them apart.&nbsp;2400 years later, Oscar Wilde’s dialogues attempt to do the same thing. But in our time it would seem that Eros has been sacrificed on the altar of a misguided Puritanism. How and why did this happen? When was the last time you read a work of philosophy that was imbued—if not generated—by Eros?</p><p><strong>SW:</strong> Roland Barthes’ <em>A Lover’s Discourse</em> springs to mind. It is certainly not a new book, but it is far away enough from the Greeks for us to be able to discern what has happened to our dear Eros since its birth in the ancient world. It is worth mentioning that Barthes never uses the term Eros: instead, concepts such as “gaudium” and “laetitia” (stolen from Leibniz) appear. And of course: love. For what is Eros if not love, after all? Barthes writes fragmentarily and makes no claim to present a definitive doctrine (much like our dialogue). Gaudium is the lasting pleasure, laetitia is the fleeting one. Unfortunately, many of us have to make do with the latter, says Barthes. Why? Is love so fleeting, or are we humans unable to hold on to it? Much of his reasoning points to the fact that it is a struggle between reason and emotion. There is a need for restraint that our bodies are unable to maintain once Eros overpowers us. Love makes us mad: the one who loves goes into an abstraction, like young Werther.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Am I in love? --yes, since I am waiting. The other one never waits. Sometimes I want to play the part of the one who does not wait; I try to busy myself elsewhere, to arrive late; but I always lose at this game. Whatever I do, I find myself there, with nothing to do, punctual, even ahead of time. The lover's fatal identity is precisely this: I am the one who waits.</p></blockquote>


<p>Eros has gone from being the force that creates and shapes the world to being a desire, a void that we want to fill as soon as possible. Sometimes I wonder if we humans lack the right patience for Eros to be a productive force. Maybe our longing is misdirected. Socrates spoke of truth and beauty as the goal.</p><p>I suggest that the sacrifice of Eros took place for two reasons. The first is that there is a very destructive side to it. I am thinking of Thomas Mann's <em>Death in Venice</em>, in which poor Gustav von Aschenbach first experiences a renaissance of his creation (inspired by Eros) but then falls so far into ruin that he is unable to leave the object of his desire, and falls victim to the ravaging plague. If we return to the Greeks again and look at what their poets have to say about the effect of Eros, we find in Sappho the suggestive description “the melter of limbs”. Eros is something that sticks; a jar of honey. It attacks the boundary of the self and dissolves it, making it obscure. Furthermore, the Greeks have descriptions of Eros as something piercing, crushing and poisoning: there is a strong preoccupation with the body and its integrity. The second reason, I think, is that Eros is extremely demanding. It makes us aware of our capacity for happiness and for pleasure, and requires that we live our lives in accordance with this knowledge. It becomes a kind of filter through which we examine our lives and are forced to decide what really has any significance for us. Eros permeates so many more aspects of our lives than the four walls of the bedroom. Blake certainly understood this when he spoke of a new heaven. Could our contemporary distortion of Eros be due to the fact that we are afraid to let go of the reins? Or is it rather the opposite, that our medialized society has fed us with so many opportunities and impressions that we have been desensitized to the more sensual side of Eros?</p><p><strong>JS:&nbsp;</strong>The pleasures and perils of delay: the Eros of <em>waiting</em>. Now’s there an interesting slant-- Gogo and Didi erotically bound to each other as they wait for Godot. Is there something more erotic about the wait than the fulfilment? Waiting for the dialogue to re-appear in your mailbox. Waiting for the valentine. Waiting for ideas. The decidedly unerotic tempo and frantic pace of [post]modern life is consonant with the necessity of instant gratification. Amazon.com flows like a mighty river of cheap goods to your doorstep in record time so that the moment of want and the moment of gratification are nearly the same. How far is the diminishment of Eros in our lives both cause and effect of our dislike of delay? In art, kitsch is the sign of this hastiness because it takes no time to produce and no time to consume. On the other hand, Nietzsche writes of “the slow arrow of beauty” in ways that seem altogether erotic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="">The slow arrow of beauty. The most noble kind of beauty is that which does not carry us away suddenly, whose attacks are not violent or intoxicating (this kind easily awakens disgust), but rather the kind of beauty which infiltrates slowly, which we carry along with us almost unnoticed, and meet up with again in dreams; finally, after it has for a long time lain modestly in our heart, it takes complete possession of us, filling our eyes with tears, our hearts with longing. What do we long for when we see beauty? To be beautiful. We think much happiness must be connected with it. But that is an error.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="">Like Eros, beauty takes [its] time. In Plato’s dialogue, we must wait for the best logos to emerge in and through the most erotic thing of all: the dialectic itself: the play of voices as they strive to give birth to beautiful speeches. The slow Eros of beauty. Have we become deadened to the distinct pleasure of delay, of waiting, of slowness? Is intellectual foreplay the best play in town? Is the devouring of pornography a sure sign that the need for intoxicating, sudden gratification is overwhelming an older delight in slow infiltrations of beauty?</span></p><p><strong style="">SW:</strong><span style=""> Wait, preparation and intensification are the core of eroticism. It is the same with reading as with Eros, I would say. The act of reading and the act of love are also acts of stretching for something. Stretching for the knowledge of the unfinished text, stretching for the beloved. Fulfilment is the goal, but as soon as we have received the object of our longing, Eros ceases. It lacks the charm of novelty, as Oscar Wilde would have put it. Eros’ aim is to let the unknown remain unknown. The erotic thing about reading — and writing — is the very imagination, the void in which we are allowed to fantasize. Uncertainty and irregularity: these elements play an important role when it comes to Eros. The most erotic point is the gap between the trousers and the shirt, the one that makes the mind wander. Knowing for sure that fulfilment is within reach does not inspire us and does not awaken our Eros. What our modern society misses (pornography and kitsch are excellent examples) is suspension. I am thinking of Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska whose love is so tremendous precisely because it is never fulfilled or consumed. The bittersweet feeling is stronger and more lasting than the elusive satisfaction. Keats also writes beautifully about suspension.</span></p>



<blockquote><pre>Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love!
For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
For ever panting, and for ever young;
All breathing human passion far above,
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.</pre></blockquote>


<p><span style="">The mighty river of Amazon.com does not upset our emotions and creates no tension within us. We know in advance that we will get what we want. Eros never gets a chance to enchant us. The moment of want and the moment of gratification are the same, as you suggest. Who is to blame for this decay? The progressive thinking of the 19th century? The advancement of technology? Much has contributed to our unwillingness to renounce anything or having to wait. The question we have to ask ourselves is perhaps rather how to regain a sense of Eros. Do we have any practices at our disposal?</span></p><p><strong style="">JS:&nbsp;</strong><span style="">Keats’s erotic delays in poem after poem, metaphor after metaphor, show Eros in its preferred element. What are figures of speech: a series of delays as a signifier stretches languorously—or hovers over—or reaches feverishly—towards the long-awaited signified.&nbsp;</span></p>


<blockquote><pre>Beyond a mortal man impassion'd far
At these voluptuous accents, he arose,
Ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star
Seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose;
Into her dream he melted, as the rose
Blendeth its odour with violet,—
Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows
Like Love's alarum, pattering the sharp sleet
Against the window-panes; St. Agnes' moon hath set.</pre></blockquote>



<p>Poetry seems to me our most reliable and piquant practice for keeping Eros alive. Poetry is often difficult, slow, labored, and luxurious. Milton makes us wait for it. Homer was our first teacher in the art of waiting, as one epic simile after another unfolds in its own good time. My Master’s Thesis was on Petrarch’s love poetry as a lover’s discourse, and I folded together the Rime sparse and Barthes’s semiological analysis of the mechanisms of love. Like you, I was first alerted to the sexiness of gaps in texts as analogues to gaps in clothing, where the eager eye strays into flashes of insight, flashes of flesh. Geoffrey Hartman once gave a lecture suggesting that meaning and moaning are etymological cousins. He’s a bit wrong, there, but his thoughts were teasing, tantalizing intimations of Eros, suffering, pain, and semantic delight that got us all <em>slowly</em> thinking. In graduate school at UVA, we waited for Hartman or deMan or Derrida or Rorty to speak with the same agonized anticipation of Socrates waiting for Phaedrus to deliver his speech (from a scroll hidden in his clothing, there, where the garment leaves gaps): a sense of longing transmitted to the reader, who sees the text coming, page after page, all of it “still to be enjoyed.”&nbsp;</p><p>But how else does Eros keep us waiting and forever warm?</p><p><strong>SW:</strong> Eros keeps us waiting through music. Music and poetry are similar because time is malleable to both of them. They can either play with it or challenge it. The prelude of Bach’s <em>St Matthew Passion</em> is dark and lamenting: it seeks to overcome its inertia and rise up, but is held down to the depths of the relentlessly repetitive keynote. It contains the greatest freedom and the greatest restraint in one and the same tone. Music instils a feeling of Eros because it makes us aware of our limits: either the inadequacy of our imagination or our incapability to ascribe a meaning towards music by using language. We are once again confronted with the act of stretching for something long-awaited.</p><p>Wagner’s <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> takes advantage of harmonic tension to evoke Eros. The opera’s chromaticism, prolonged unfinished cadences and shifting of the tonal center create a feeling of infinite longing. Wagner pushes the tension to its absolute limit and lets the notes stretch for hours in a single unbroken arc. The cadences introduced in the prelude do not reach their resolution until the end of the opera. Furthermore, Wagner introduces a series of chords building in tension—building up towards a climax—only to suddenly interrupt them. He keeps us on the edge of our seats, warm and waiting.</p><p>Longing is both painful and sweet, desirable and unbearable. We love to rest in the warm embrace of expectation, but sooner or later our desire must be quenched. Just as the music eventually quietens and the poem reaches it end, our nervous Eros must be calmed down as well. What Wagner wanted to capture with his opera was the endless torture of love, of Eros.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[There is] henceforth no end to the yearning, longing, rapture, and misery of love: world, power, fame, honor, chivalry, loyalty, and friendship, scattered like an insubstantial dream; one thing alone left living: longing, longing unquenchable, desire forever renewing itself, craving and languishing; one sole redemption: death, surcease of being, the sleep that knows no waking.</p></blockquote>



<p>We love chasing Eros only to chase him away: it’s a hopeless affair. Yet one always finds oneself back in his arms again. We demand a second poem, a second composition, a second moan. It all feels a bit futile. As soon as we feel elevated and close to some form of truth, we are suddenly drawn down to earth again. Something inside me awakened tonight when I listened to Bach again, but just as I was about to reach out to whatever immortal hand that must have touched me, it vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Is there any point to it all? Must there be? Perhaps we should be happy and content with the pleasures we are given and not question them or ask for too much (although one would like to).</p><p><strong>JS:&nbsp;</strong>The most erotic pun in English: to be <em>chaste</em> is to be <em>chased</em>. Love lyric poets do not shy away from this rather obvious moaning/meaning. And Keats was always alive to this chasing down of intimacy.</p>


<blockquote><pre>Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
Thou foster-child of silence and slow time…</pre>
</blockquote>


<p class="ql-align-justify">A late-Romantic, Wagner certainly did understand the promised land of yearning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no country, no town, no village that I can call my own. Everything is alien to me and I often gaze around, yearning for a glimpse of the land of&nbsp;Nirvāṇa. But&nbsp;Nirvāṇa&nbsp;quickly turns back into 'Tristan'; you know the Buddhist theory of the origin of the world. A breath&nbsp;clouds the clear expanse of heaven: it swells and grows denser, and finally the whole world stands before me again in all its impenetrable solidity.</p></blockquote>


<p>But isn’t Bach far subtler than Wagner?&nbsp;I return to <em>St Matthew Passion</em> far more than I return to <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. And each time I wait for the same phrase because I can actually feel it healing my ragged soul each time I absorb it. It is not a sexual healing, but it is surely a kind erotic balm tonally presented to both delight and, in my case, salve. I do think music is full of teasing delays, all the more potent, perhaps, for not rising to crashing crescendos, but rather presented, for example, as violin phrases, delicate sprays of salvation, as we have between 1:15:00 and 1:16:00 in <em>Passion</em>. The Tristan Chord is a little like Heathcliff and Cathy crushing each other to morsels in the bedroom scene: their ‘wuthering’ Liebestod. But Bach does not go for big scenes and crushingly chromatic acoustics. As you suggest, his Eros is a matter of restraint. It is neo-classical, not romantic. What is more erotic than holding back? Is the most erotic place or space <em>not</em> where the garment or the text leaves gaps, but where the imagination must give full rein to itself precisely because the artist’s restraint is so ravishing? Was Kant, after all, onto something when he makes aesthetic pleasure of matter of being <em>completely</em> disinterested and detached?</p><p><strong>SW:</strong> Your quote from Wagner reminds me of a line from one of Petrarch’s poems, who also knew a few things about longing.</p><blockquote>I am a citizen of no place, everywhere I am a stranger</blockquote><p>Petrarch’s last letter, addressed to posterity, is interrupted by the announcement that he is—once again—about to make a new journey. Not to see again what he has already seen before, but because he suffers from a morbid desire to cure his boredom by changing his place of residence. Eros keeps us on our feet.</p><p>Bach is much more subtle than Wagner, yes. Wagner is eager to depict the desires of the starry-eyed couple while Bach chooses to restrain himself. Bach captures the living Eros, Wagner captures its quest to get rid of itself. However, I do not think Kant has anything to add in terms of the erotic. The pleasure he talks about is not dependent on desire and does not generate such a thing either. Is it possible to be so intuitive, to experience something without relating it to previous experiences and knowledge, as Kant suggests? We can stand in front of Canova's <em>Amore e Psiche</em> and enjoy its perfection, but if we remain disinterested in the work of art, we will soon forget it. And what's the point of that? Detached enjoyment does not touch us and does not lead us anywhere. Eros wants to push us forward, to the next level. It is his mission; therefore, he is a God. Is it erotic to hold back? Is the most erotic point the one we can only see with our inner eye? Yes, there we have an interesting reasoning. It reminds me of a couple of lines from a poem by Yves Bonnefoy.</p>




<center><em><p>Aimer la perfection parce qu’elle est le seuil,<br>
Mais la nier sitôt connue, l’oublier morte,</p>
<p>L’imperfection est la cime.</p></em>

<p>Love perfection because it is the threshold,<br>
But once known disown it, once dead forget it,</p>
<p>Imperfection is the summit.</p></center>



<p>To keep Eros—and ourselves—alive we must continue to strive forward. Our longing is perhaps a goal in itself, to keep us from stagnating. The more we explore Eros, the more it feels as if he is fleeing from us. Kant believed that the beautiful is concerned with form while the sublime is often formless. Do you think we can say something about the erotic and the sublime?</p><p><strong>JS:&nbsp;</strong>In her slender book of meditations, <em>Eros the bittersweet</em>, Anne Carson presents a Greek pun that should detain us. In <em>Phaedrus</em>, Socrates tells us:</p>


<blockquote><p>Mortals call him winged Love, but the immortals call him<br>The winged One, because he must needs grow wings.</p></blockquote>


<p>Plato etymologically feathers together <em>eros</em> and <em>pteros</em>: desire is a winged thing: always in flight, always in Keatsian pursuit: always—as you say—<em>longing</em>: stretching itself towards what it so feverishly desires. Amore must have wings to fly to his beloved. Any sculpture must marble forth the wings and freeze them in time. Are words a more winged medium than marble? And what about what Byron calls “the eloquence of action,” the time when Eros, ever on the wing, swoops down and captures the heart? That can be, of course, the end of Eros but is delay really a consummation devoutly to be wished? To be endlessly in pursuit can also be exhausting, no? Desire is maddening and Werther is truly love-sick. As is Aschenbach. If eros is to be mostly an affair of the mind, then why involve the body at all? But isn’t the sight of the beautiful form—or body—the beginning of all eros? And when we climb the ladder of love and find perfect right triangles and dialectical clarity waiting for us at the top, do we recall anything of the physical beauty that excited us in the first place? Should we?</p><p><strong>SW:</strong> We are inexorably tied to our bodies and to distinguish between it and our mind is useless. Both are important and that Eros finds expression in both parts I find only natural. The physical and the sensual desire both want the same thing—to merge with the coveted, to give birth to something new. Bodies merge and give birth to our heirs, thoughts merge and give birth to knowledge. The dialogue we have with each other right now is only possible because others have engaged in the same practice in the past, from Plato’s time to our own. Previous thinkers’ quest for knowledge has given rise to yours and my quest to do the same. It is all the same desire.</p><p>Werther and Aschenbach are both sick with desire, yes. Eros has its pitfalls and one has to be careful not to fall down. There is, of course, a Darwinian aspect of our conversation that we have not touched yet and that I choose to avoid for the time being. I find the philosophical side more interesting, and I would like to believe that Eros is more mind than body. However, I do not think we should forget about physical beauty completely. A beautiful face, a pair of soft hands, a nice waist—these are not to be underestimated. We hammer the marble after our bodies for a reason. Why do we find ballet so compelling, for example? The first time I saw <em>Swan Lake</em> I got tears in my eyes. The beauty of the movement of a slender body inspires and engages our thoughts. Mind and body are connected — you cannot have one without the other. The original beauty we experience does not become less beautiful as we learn how to see it in other forms. On the contrary, we learn to appreciate it even more.</p><p>What do you think Socrates saw at the top of that ladder? Peace on earth? Eternal happiness? Infinite time to finish reading the books on our bookshelf? And what is the eternal idea of beauty? Perhaps Socrates was blinded by Eros as well—always striving, always reaching higher.</p><p><strong>JS:&nbsp;</strong>Just as Yeats needed bodies for his souls and images for his ideas, Eros needs a little curtain of flesh to rustle and ruffle our interest. Your thoughts immediately brought to mind these lines:</p>


<blockquote><pre>O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
How can we know the dancer from the dance?</pre></blockquote>
